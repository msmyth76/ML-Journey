# My ML Projects

# Traditional Machine Learning
- Iris Dataset - Performed data analysis on the iris dataset and used a logistic regression model to classify the species of each flower. The final model had an accuracy of 100% using all four predictors (sepal length (cm), sepal width (cm), petal length (cm), petal width (cm)).  
_Skills Demonstrated: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Data Preprocessing, Jupyter Notebook, Logistic Regression_

- Titanic Survival Dataset - Performed data analysis on the titanic survival dataset and used a random forest classifier to determine whether a person did or did not survive the titanic disaster. The final model had an accuracy of 78.70% on the test data which was verified by Kaggle.
